# Getting Started
The WhisperTrack Software is made up of 2 main components: WhisperTrack Software and the Fontus Spec.
## Build WhisperTrack Software
Building the software has been made as simple as possible. The only requirement is that you have [Docker](../Other Resources/containerization.md) or similar container orchestrator installed. The software is built using a Dockerfile, which can be found in the `docker` folder of [the repository](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Software). Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Software/blob/main/README.md) given in the repository to build the software.
## Fontus Spec
The Fontus Spec defines the open standard for on-demand gear location and retrieval, providing the foundation for safe, efficient, and interoperable fishing operations.  
We highly recommend reviewing the [full specification](fontus-spec.md) to understand how it enables real-time gear tracking, lost gear recovery, and secure communication.
