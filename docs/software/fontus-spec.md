# FONTUS Spec
## What is FONTUS?
- **FONTUS** is an **[open standard](../assets/files/FONTUS_open_standard_v1_0.pdf)** designed for **on-demand gear location marking, retrieval, lost gear recovery, and enforcement** in the fishing industry.
- It supports **buoyless (ropeless) fishing gear**, where traditional marking buoys and endlines are removed to reduce entanglement risks for marine life such as whales.
- The system integrates **three subsystems**:
  1. **Acoustic devices** attached to fishing gear on the sea floor.
  2. **Shipboard systems** that communicate with devices and the cloud.
  3. A **cloud database** that stores and shares gear location and status information.

## Key Features of FONTUS
- **Real-time gear location sharing**: Gear positions are accessible to fishers, enforcement agencies, and regulators, ensuring safe navigation and preventing gear conflict.
- **Automatic deployment and recovery reporting** via RFID detection — no manual reporting needed.
- **Accurate localization** of gear with a target accuracy of about 25 feet (8 meters) in high-density fishing areas.
- **Lost gear discovery and recovery** supported through acoustic communication and cloud notifications.
- **On-demand release mechanism** integration for gear retrieval triggered acoustically and securely.
- **Multi-manufacturer compatibility**: Ensures devices from different manufacturers can communicate and interoperate.
- **Environmental considerations**: Minimizes acoustic noise and battery usage to reduce marine impact.

## What Does It Mean to Be Open?
- **Open standard** means FONTUS is publicly documented and available for manufacturers, fishers, regulators, and developers.
- Enables **interoperability** between different manufacturers’ gear and systems.
- Facilitates **transparent and real-time data sharing** for all stakeholders.
- Encourages industry-wide **collaboration and innovation** in on-demand fishing technology.
- Compliance with **international regulations** and supports cross-border fisheries enforcement.

## Why Use FONTUS?
- Addresses critical **marine conservation issues** by reducing marine life entanglements.
- Prevents **gear conflict and economic loss** by clearly marking gear locations.
- Provides a **scalable and standardized solution** for both inshore and offshore fisheries.
- Supports **enforcement and compliance** through real-time data access.
- Improves **fishing efficiency and safety** with automated location and retrieval functions.


## Additional Benefits
- Designed to work with existing **chart plotters** and standard marine navigation hardware.
- Supports **cloud-based tracking**, allowing for extensive data analytics and long-term gear management.
- Accommodates both **mobile and fixed fishers** by adapting gear location data delivery accordingly.
- Promotes **sustainable fishing practices** by integrating environmental safeguards.
