# WhisperTrack Trap-Side Modem Hardware Design Files
## Schematic

The schematic for the WhisperTrack Trap-Side Modem printed circuit board (PCB) can be found [here](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Hardware/tree/master/Schematic). The schematic is provided in PDF and Cadence OrCAD Capture v17.4 (.dsn) formats. 

## PCB Layout

The PCB layout design file for the WhisperTrack Trap-Side Modem PCB can be found [here](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Hardware/tree/master/Layout). The layout design file is provided in Cadence OrCAD Layout v17.4 (.brd) format. 

## PCB Build Files

The native PCB layout design file above is not the correct format for sending to a contract manufacturer (CM) for production of completed PCBAs. There are a variety of formats that CMs will typically accept, the most common being Gerbers. The build file package for the WhisperTrack Trap-Side Modem PCB can be found [here](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Hardware/tree/master/Build%20Files). There is a readme file within the build file archive that describes all the file contents. 

## Bill of Materials

The bill of materials (BOM) for the WhisperTrack Trap-Side Modem PCB assembly (PCBA) can be found [here](https://github.com/Delresearch/WhisperTrack-Hardware/tree/master/BOM). The BOM file is provided in Excel (.xlsx) format and lists all the components required to be populated on the PCB to create the complete PCBA. For many components, more than one manufacturer part number is provided that are equivalent to use to aid sourcing. 

The complete Trap-Side Modem BOM, including all mechanical components, is coming soon!
