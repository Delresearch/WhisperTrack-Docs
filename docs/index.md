# WhisperTrack Modem

## Mission Statement
Helping the North Atlantic Right Whale and beyond.

## Problem Statement
The North Atlantic right whale migrates along the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada, directly through the New England commercial fisheries. The overlap of the whales' habitat with fishing areas increases the likelihood of entanglement in fishing gear. Because of their small population size, any deaths due to entanglement have a significant impact on the species' ability to recover. Recent studies show that the deaths from fishing gear entanglements exceed the population's reproductive rate.

## Solution Overview
The WhisperTrack project provides a complete solution for rope-less fishing. WhisperTrack is an innovative technology that introduces a trap-side single-chip acoustic modem solution, revolutionizing trap retrieval in rope-less fishing.

## Trap-Side Modem Design
The acoustic modem, which is compactly potted into the transducer, serves as the control hub for release mechanisms like lift backs or rope spools. This integrated solution enables precise signaling for trap retrieval while eliminating the need for vertical lines that pose entanglement risks to marine life.

## Ship-Side System
To ensure accurate geolocation and seamless communication, the WhisperTrack ship side complements the trap side with a low-cost USBL system and sensor fusion techniques. This combination provides reliable and efficient tracking of trap locations without relying on expensive gyroscopes or complex equipment.

## Cost & Open Source Commitment
One of the main goals of WhisperTrack is to reduce the cost barrier for entry. The target cost for the trap-side modem is under $200. The software running on the modem is completely Open Source and the API for communication is based on open standards.

## Getting Started
The WhisperTrack modem is comprised of two main components: the [software](software/getting-started-with-software.md) and the [hardware](hardware/TrapSideHardwareOverview.md). The software is responsible for controlling the modem and communicating with the ship-side system, while the hardware is responsible for the physical communication with the traps. If you are interested in learning more about how the technology works, please check out the [documentation](how-whispertrack-works.md) for more information.
